# IBM_Watson_VR
Classifying images of beds, tables and chairs, and finding the accuracy of classification, using IBM VR
The project is a part of the Coursera IBM Applied AI certification. This project uses IBM Watson and Open CV to classify  different types of furniture. Watson was trained to identify each category (30 images each) of furniture with a confidence score of 75% and above. Watson was then tested with new images (previously unused for training), to confirm that it was able to differentiate between these three types of furniture with a high confidence score.
